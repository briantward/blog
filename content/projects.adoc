== Projects and Goals

These are tasks, idea, goals that I am currently pursuing.  This page will change as I update and work on various blog pages.  Maybe in the future I will have a way for visitors to upvote priority on some of these tasks.

1. Dnsmasq setup for VPN DNS control.
2. Bridge host-vm network.
3. Fluentd-sumologic daemonset on kubernetes/OpenShift.
4. RH-SSO/Keycloak with Google Hosted Domain authenticating to an OpenShift cluster.
5. RH-SSO/Keycloak custom authenticators and other features.
6. Smartcard authenticator for RH-SSO/Keycloak.
7. Automate my RHEV/OpenShift provisioning with Ansible.

9. AD forest trust with RH-IdM.
10. Sync kerberos/identities with MacOSX.
