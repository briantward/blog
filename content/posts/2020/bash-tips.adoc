== Command Tips

String the watch command with several commands at once

 watch 'command | othertool | yet-another-tool'

This one is useful when you don't have a user directory on the system yet.  

 /sbin/mkhomedir_helper <username> [<umask> [<skeldir>]]

Because docker rmi on all image IDs doesn't work when one image ID maps to multiple repo:tag combinations.

 $ docker images | grep -v REPO | awk '{print $1":"$2}' | xargs docker rmi

Otherise this works fine:
 
 $ docker images -q | xargs docker rmi

Or 

 $ docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)

Remove exited containers:

 $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)

 $ docker system prune -a
