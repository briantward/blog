== Running a Container as a Systemd Service on Fedora and RHEL

There is some great documentation on this:

- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/building_running_and_managing_containers/using-systemd-with-containers_building-running-and-managing-containers[Chapter 7. Running containers as systemd services with Podman]
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/building_running_and_managing_containers/container-command-line-reference_building-running-and-managing-containers#generate_a_systemd_unit_file[Chapter 8. Container command-line reference: 8.1.10. Generate a systemd unit file]

Even better there is a man page:

 $ man podman-generate-systemd

The basic command looks like this, to be run on an existing running container:

 $ podman generate systemd --name myfedora > ~/.config/systemd/user

Then stop the same container so we can test the systemd startup:

 $ podman stop --name myfedora
 $ systemctl --user start container-myfedora.service

To enable this at bootup:

 $ systemctl --user enable container-myfedora.service
