== SSH Tips

=== SSH Tunnel
 
 $ ssh user@remote-host -L 9993:remote-host:9993

=== SSH Keyen

 $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email organization"

=== SSH-Forwarding

Like this guy's example.  After using `nc` for years, `ProxyJump` is now very useful!

=== ForwardAgent

I'm not truly certain about the security implications of using ForwardAgent, but this article does suggest there are some issues.  Regardless, the `ProxyJump` feature seems to handle everything I need.

=== Sshuttle

This is useful for forwarding DNS requests through to another network, so that you can make local DNS requests in that network, without building a whole VPN service.

 sshuttle --dns -r HOSTNAME 192.168.1.0/24 -v
