https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/applications/index#gitops-config

=== ArgoCD GitOps for Configuration Management

GitOps instance per ManagedClusterSet

Things that make you pick single, central:

- Good starting point
- Simple management, single place

Things that make you change to distributed:

- One ArgoCD is overloaded.
- Separation of duties.  One ArgoCD for Production. One ArgoCD for NonProduction.
- Separation of use.  E.G. PCI Compliance, separation of elements in different clusters
- Separation of Teams, RBAC. Provide ArgoCD per major team or organization.

ACM vs independent GitOps

- ACM is a centralized Hub model.  You can still run multiple ArgoCD from ACM using different ManagedClusterSets.
- If you don't have ACM, GitOps can be run natively in clusters as desired, distributed (multiple instances) or centralized (single instance).
- If you do have ACM but don't want to use ManagedClusterSets, you can also deploy ACM Policy to deploy GitOps
- If you do have ACM, you can also use GitOps to manage remote cluster infrastructure as well (in lieu of ACM Policy)
- ACM also offers a native Application/Subscription model for placing applications in clusters, but this has been less popular
