== Helpful Filesystem Tips

- change reserved space on ext4 partitions to zero.  Useful for drives specifically for data storage and no system recovery needed.

  # tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdb1

- print UUID of filesystems

  # blkid

- remount a readonly filesystem to rewrite

  # mount -o remount,rw /

- watch the status of dd (useful on systems without "status=progress", like Mac I think)

  # kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)

- lazy unmount an NFS mount that no longer exists on the network, if it's hung

  # umount -l /media/bosch

- fill entire disk with one partition, using optimized sector allocation

  # parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary 0% 100%

- format disk partition

 # mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
