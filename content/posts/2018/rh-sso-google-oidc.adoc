== Configure RH-SSO to Identity Broker with Google by Hosted Domain

In a browser, go to your RH-SSO admin console.  This should be your hostname with context `/auth/admin`, e.g. 
https://sso.apps.example.com/auth/admin/

////

Login with the username and password you set in your template for fields:

 SSO_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
 SSO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=redacted 

First, create a new realm for your OpenShift users.  Out of the box, RH-SSO is configured with a master realm,
but this should only be used for administration of the RH-SSO server itself. Hover over the name "Master" on the left
menu bar, then click `Add Realm`.

Name your realm something such as `ocp` and click `Create`.

Click on `Identity Providers` on the left menu bar.

Click the dropdown `Add provider...` and choose `OpenID Connect v1.0` from the dropdown.  
Note that there is an easy-setup for Google. Do not use this one, as it
does not allow you to configure the hosted domain.

Note your redirect URI will be needed to configure the Google OIDC client in the Google Cloud Console. Add that now if you haven't already done so.

I named mine `google-oidc`. Enter the following fields:

- Alias: google-oidc
- Display Name: google-oidc
- Authorization URL: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?hd=example.com
- Token URL: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/token
- Disable User Info: Choose ON
- User Info URL: https://www.googleapis.com/plus/v1/people/me/openIdConnect
- Client ID: YOUR_GOOGLE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID
- Client Secret: YOUR_GOOGLE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET
- Default Scopes: openid profile email

Now you need to activate the broker profile you just setup.

Click `Authentication` from the left menu bar.

On the `Flows` tab choose from the dropdown menu `Browser`.

Click the `copy` button on the top right. Name it something like `Browser-GoogleIDP` and click `ok`.

You can use the default Browser flow as well, but here we made a new one to preserve the original default and give 
us some flexibility.  

Since we don't want `Kerberos` or `Browser-GoogleIDP Forms`, click `Actions` > `Delete` for both of them. The former
works when federating a kerberos/ldap server, which we are not doing here.  The latter would provide a form login 
when Google IDP failed to identify a user.  In our case, all the users in our corporate directory are using Google, 
so we know that's the only auth mechanism we want.  Leave the `Cookie` auth flow in place because that's what is responsible
for the SSO between other apps authenticating with the RH-SSO server that we may add later.

Now on the `Identity Provider Redirector` flow, click `Actions` > `Config`.  Give it any alias but be sure `Default Identity Provider`
matches the identity provider alias you chose in the steps above when creating the OIDC provider.  Click `Save`.

Go back to `Authentication Flows` or choose `Authentication` from the left menu bar.  Click on `Bindings`. Change `Browser Flow` to 
`Browser-GoogleIDP` or whatever you named your new flow.  Click `Save`.

Your RH-SSO server is now configured for your Google authentication.

TODO: add a few other good configurations, such as SSL only.


Debug Notes:

I ran into this issue where OpenShift did not authenticate my user, but rather gave me this "Could not create user." error.
I came to realize that while I had been deleting the test user in RH-SSO to perform various scenario tests,
I had failed to delete the user created in OpenShift as well.  If you are deleting and recreating your test user, be sure 
to delete it both from RH-SSO and OpenShift.

 $ oc delete user USER_NAME
