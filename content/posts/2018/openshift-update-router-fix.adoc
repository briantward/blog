== OpenShift Update Router Fix

Updating from v3.11.0 to v3.11.51 introduced a new volume mount on the router that did not previously exist (or maybe something wonky just happened in my cluster). 

Log message on router pod attempting to spin up.  If you don't have one attempting to spin up now (i.e. it failed a while back and just rolled back to the previous ReplicationController), delete the latest ReplicationController (not the one running the good pods!) and a new builder pod and router pods will attempt to spin up.

$ oc logs -f router-30-kt2xm
I1213 18:14:12.340638       1 template.go:297] Starting template router (v3.11.51)
error: open /etc/pki/tls/metrics/tls.crt: no such file or directory

The fix is quite simple.  Add the metrics-server-certificate volume pointing to your existing certificate file. 

 $ oc set volume dc/router --add --mount-path=/etc/pki/tls/metrics --secret-name='router-certs' --name metrics-server-certificate
