== Pulseaudio Customization

Stop pulseaudio from messing around with your sound levels while in the middle of conference calls on Fedora 31.  This may or may not work as intended.  I have not done this on my latest Fedora 32 and have not felt the need for it.  Previous releases I have had the problem of pulseaudio changing my microphone input levels dynamically.  People on the other end claim that my input volume would go down drastically.


 $ sudo vim /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/paths/analog-input-mic.conf
