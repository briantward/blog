== Building a Media Server

A while back I was on the hunt for a media server solution... these are running notes about 2 years old as of now (2/2021).

=== Handling video playback and copying DVD content to my digital storage.

This was interesting but looked a bit old.  Dunno much about how old nux-desktop-release-0-5 is.

yum -y install http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
yum -y install 
yum install ffmpeg HandBrake-cli
----

Could make a totally custom build of Handbrake on the latest Fedora, which is what Handbrake's website suggests.

Followed these instructions to create a base container image

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=handbrake+fedora

Then these instruction to create a custom build of latest Handbrake from source:

https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/developer/build-linux.html

Create a Dockerfile from the basics of this article.

 dnf install https://download0.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download0.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

 dnf install handbrake

handbrake vs makemkv

- makemkv will rip without loss


=== Media server search

Started with PMS, Plex Media Server. What a terrible acronym. Let's just call it Plex. I got this working from its official Docker image with a little work, to run using rootless containers with Podman instead of Docker. But I found out this requires a login to authorize and synchronize machine access.  Bleh.  How awful.  The whole point of running my own software is that I control it without any phone home to another third party organization.  Plex is dumped. I know how to manage my networking, and I don't care about UPNP.

Then I checked out Emby, as others recommended after finding the auth requirement for Plex.  It has a Tizen app for Samsung TVs so looks promising. But on first load of my test ISO, it failed to play properly.  No ISO support.  Ok, so that is asking a lot I suppose, but it's a lot of work for me to convert hundreds of DVD ISOs to mp4 or mkv.  

Then I checked out Kodi, which appears to be the first for many to select.  I didn't care much for the fact that they did not build their own container images.  Linuxserver.io however builds one, and it worked fairly well I think.  But I never figured out how to get the headless kodi instance to scan any particular folders for media.  Maybe it was the web browser interface, Chorus.  After 20 minutes of searching the web for answers and clicking around in the interface, I decided this idea was dead.  Kodi apparently supports ISO, which is a huge plus for me, but it does not have a Tizen native app.

So back to Emby.  It looks as though I'll be building a process to convert all my ISO images to mp4.

- For future readers (as this was high up in the search results): this is a conflict between s6-overlay and podman, triggered by the name of the entrypoint (init).

- Set `--systemd=false` to prevent the mounting behaviour that causes this conflict. (Source) +

[source]
----
man podman run
...
       --systemd=true|false

       Run container in systemd mode. The default is true.

       If the command you running inside of the container is systemd or init, podman will setup tmpfs mount points in the following directories:

       /run, /run/lock, /tmp, /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd, /var/lib/journal

       It will also set the default stop signal to SIGRTMIN+3.

       This allow systemd to run in a confined container without any modifications.

       Note: On SELinux systems, systemd attempts to write to the cgroup file system.  Containers writing to the cgroup file system are denied by default.  The container_manage_cgroup boolean must be enabled for this to be allowed
       on an SELinux separated system.

       setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup true

`podman system migrate` is useful sometimes upgrading from older Podman configs to newer ones.

The above is a podman thing.  We gotta set up our system to handle rootless.  The first go I ran this on an upgraded RHEL 7 box and had to tweak some things.  RHEL 8 and Fedora have this stuff set up default now.
