== Lenovo Intel i915 Video Drivers in Linux, Part 3

Problem Scenario/Steps: +
Lenovo T460s +
thinkpad ultra dock P/N SD20A06046 Type 40A2 S/N M3-A0AC8E 16/11+
fedora 26/27/28/29, according to my records any kernel since 4.15.9-300.fc27.x86_64

1. Dock laptop in docking station with two connected monitors, one HDMI and one DVI.
2. Undock laptop.
3. Redock laptop -> screen failure and system lock until undock again.  Leave it long enough and it will reboot itself.

This issue was resolved by work in the 4.20 kernel!
