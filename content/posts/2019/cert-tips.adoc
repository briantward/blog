# cat << 'EOF' >> check-certs.sh
#!/bin/bash

for filename in `find /etc/origin -name "*.crt*" -o -name "*.pem*" -o -name "*.cer*"` ; do
  echo $filename;
  echo "  contains" `grep BEGIN $filename | wc -l`;
  openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile $filename | openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -text -noout | grep -E "Issuer:|Subject:|Not|CA"
done
EOF

# chmod u+x ./check-certs.sh
# ./check-certs.sh > certs-$(hostname)-$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S").log
