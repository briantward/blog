== Lenovo Intel i915 Video Drivers in Linux, Part 2

Problem Scenario/Steps: +
Lenovo T460s +
thinkpad ultra dock P/N SD20A06046 Type 40A2 S/N M3-A0AC8E 16/11+
fedora 26/27/28/29, according to my records any kernel since 4.15.9-300.fc27.x86_64

1. Dock laptop in docking station with two connected monitors, one HDMI and one DVI.
2. Undock laptop.
3. Redock laptop -> screen failure and system lock until undock again.  Leave it long enough and it will reboot itself.

Interestingly enough for myself, I have another docking station with two DisplayPort monitors that does not produce this problem.

In Part 1, I ended up with a somewhat misdirected analysis.  So here is the new working solution I have come up with.

I had still been having problems getting the video drivers to work correctly the second time I docked my laptop.  See these bugs for similar descriptions and issues.  

- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1470960[Bug 1470960 - when docking: [drm:intel_wait_ddi_buf_idle [i915\] *ERROR* Timeout waiting for DDI BUF C idle bit]

- https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107546[Bug 107546 - Screen is frozen on second connection of DP MST dock] - This one is the closest match to my problems, and where I found that the drm developers had worked on a fix in the latest 4.20 kernel, perhaps for other specific problems that happen to resolve this one as well.

I had a few options to consider for debugging this problem:

. Update to latest stable fedora release and kernel.

.. Update to vanilla kernel options.

.. Build custom drm module for current fedora kernel.

. Update to rawhide fedora release and kernel.

.. Build custom drm module for rawhide fedora kernel.

Since I was recently on fedora 28, I figured the best next step is to update to the latest fedora 29.  I ran my test against fedora 29 and found no change.  The next step was either to remain at fedora 29 and test with a later unsupported kernel or upgrade to fedora 30 or rawhide, both of which are in current development as I write this article.  Obviously none of this is supported.  Wait a minute, does anyone actually care about fedora support?  Nah, I didn't think so.  Let's just go with fedora 29 and a cutting edge kernel.  That puts the system at a stable point and the kernel at an unstable point.  Maybe that's better than both at an unstable point, but I don't care since I'm just testing stuff out and would like to have a stable system to revert back to.  


I built kernel from https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm-tip[drm-tip], where we have the latest and greatest from the development teams.  I used https://01.org/linuxgraphics/documentation/build-guide-0[documentation from intel], although the steps for building a custom kernel are pretty generic.  I didn't need to test any of the other drivers or libraries.

On my first kernel boot I made no custom changes, using the default generated ``.config`` file (created by the ``make defconfig`` step).

However I got an error from LUKS after entering my disk encryption password. 

          Starting Cryptography Setup for luks-48ef18c-7da6-4260-942b-2a203048b76f...

 [DEPEND] Dependency failed for Local Encrypted Volumes.

Since the panic did not leave me at a command prompt, nor did I figure there were any actual journals recording this event, I just popped back to the working kernel and tested output there to see what it should look like in a success.

At this point I don't know much about the internals of LUKS and its service, but I do know how to configure it when building a fedora system.  However, documenation for LUKS on fedora is flat-out awful.  Even worse is figuring out how to build a custom kernel with LUKS. I basically ran trial and error with some hints here and there from other people's problems found by your favorite search engine.

Kernel configuration changes are made in the `.config` file.

I tried setting the following...
 
 CONFIG_DM_CRYPT=y

But that alone did not work.  Then I tried this...

  # CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256 is not set
  # CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512 is not set
  CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512=y

But it corrected itself to this...

  CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA256=y
  CONFIG_CRYPTO_SHA512=y

It still did not work.  But I got a different error this time.  It seems I got a little farther!

So let's see what other configuration settings were missing.  Maybe looking a the original crytography setup (using my good kernel) will tell me something:

Searching around on the internet shows some aes-xts-plain64 things... let's set that value...

 CONFIG_CRYPTO_XTS=y

Bingo that worked!!

Here are the results from the latest drm-tip build:
