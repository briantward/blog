== Rsync Tips


- Be careful with trailing slashes with `rsync`.  Always test behavior first. Excluded directories are relative to the second-to-last folder of the copy-from arg.  Here I am copying the `some` folder.  But in order to exclude folders directly beneath `some`, I must still reference `some` in the exclusion.  Note the trailing slash at the remote location, which means the `some` folder is copied into `/bk/` rather than replacing the contents of `/bk` with the contents of `some`.

 rsync -av --delete --delete-excluded --exclude={"some/folder-A","some/folder-B"} /home/user/some remote-sys:/bk/
