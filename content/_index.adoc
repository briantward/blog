== Everyday Linux

This site is a collection of my everyday linux tasks and notes of my work.  Content is always a work in progress and not formally published.  As such, any page is subject to change, being simply updated, edited, or re-dated for newer material.  Some pages are clearly unfinished.  Nothing is guaranteed to be accurate or true and you should not depend on any content for Production use.  

Frequently I may borrow or link to other published material.  If you believe your own content is misrepresented here, please feel free to reach out to me and I will adjust content as necessary.
