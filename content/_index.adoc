== Everyday Linux

This site is a collection of my everyday linux tasks.  I consider myself 
primarily a developer and programmer, but I run into system configuration
and administration tasks on a daily basis.  I've started this collection
to remind myself of good programming practices as well as basic system
configurations that I need to get things done.  

Bear with me as I figure out this blog, hugo, and asciidoc stuff...

Don't pay attention to dates.  This is technically running on a blog engine,
but I plan on revising my work on the fly frequently.  Ideally this site will 
show you version history to help you see how my own work has progressed.
