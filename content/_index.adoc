== Everyday Linux

This site is a collection of my everyday linux tasks.  I consider myself 
primarily a developer and programmer, but I run into system configuration
and administration tasks on a daily basis.  I've started this collection
to remind myself of good programming practices as well as basic system
configurations that I need to get things done.
